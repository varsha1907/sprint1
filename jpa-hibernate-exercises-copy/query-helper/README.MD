### Task
`QueryHelper.java` is a simple API that provides a util method helps to perform read operations using `EntityManager`.

### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to be familiar with *JPA* and *Hibernate ORM*

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start implementing the **todo** section, verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the **exercise/completed** branch and see the final implementation
