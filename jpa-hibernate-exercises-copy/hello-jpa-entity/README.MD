Improve your JPA entity mapping skills
### Task
`Movie.java` is a business entity that stores some movie-related information like movie `name`, `director` and 
`duration` in second. Your job is to **implement JPA entity mapping** according to the notes in the *todo* section.  

To verify your implementation, run `JpaEntityMovieTest.java`

 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to be familiar with JPA and Hibernate ORM and be able to write Java code

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start implementing the **todo** section, verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the **exercise/completed** branch and see the final implementation
