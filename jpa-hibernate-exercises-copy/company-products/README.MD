Improve your *Hibernate Lazy loading* and *JPA Many-To-One* relationship mapping skills
### Task
Your job is to implement correct mapping between `Company` and `Product` entities, and implement `CompanyDaoImpl` 
**following the instructions in the todo section**

To verify your implementation, run `CompanyProductMappingTest.java`

 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to be familiar with *JPA* mapping strategies and *Hibernate ORM*

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start implementing the **todo** section, verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the **exercise/completed** branch and see the final implementation
