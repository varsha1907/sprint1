Improve your JPA configuration skills
### Task
In order to use *JPA* you need to configure its provider. In our case you need to configure *Hibernate ORM*. All properties
are located in **standard JPA configuration file** `persistence.xml`. Your job is to implement the todo section 
providing all required configuration.

To verify your implementation, run `JpaPersistenceUnitTest.java`

 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to be familiar with JPA and Hibernate ORM and be able to write Java code

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start implementing the **todo** section, verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the **exercise/completed** branch and see the final implementation
