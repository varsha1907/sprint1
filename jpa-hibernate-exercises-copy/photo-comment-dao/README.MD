Improve your *Hibernate ORM* and *JPA One-To-Many* relationship mapping skills
### Task
Each `Photo` has a list of `PhotoComments`. Comments cannot exits without photo associated. You job is to provide a mapping
for this **bidirectional *one to many* relationship** and **implement required DAO methods.** Please follow the instructions 
in the todo sections. 

To verify your mapping, run `PhotoCommentMappingTest.java`
To verify your DAO implementation, run `PhotoDaoTest.java`

 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to be familiar with *JPA* mapping strategies and *Hibernate ORM*

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start implementing the **todo** section, verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the **exercise/completed** branch and see the final implementation
